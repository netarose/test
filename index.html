        <H1>Freddie Mercury</H1>
        Freddie Mercury was born as Farrokh Bulsara in September 5th 1946 and died in November 24th 1991.
        <br />
        He was a British singer-songwriter, record producer and lead vocalist of the rock band Queen.
        <br />
        He is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music and was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range.
        <br />
        Mercury was born in Zanzibar to Parsi parents from India. After growing up in Zanzibar and India, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution and moved to Middlesex, England, in his late teens.
        <br />
        He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor.
        <br />
        Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Killer Queen", "Somebody to Love" and "Don't Stop Me Now".
        <br />
        Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease.
        <br />
        As a member of Queen, Mercury was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004.
        <br />
        In 1992, a year after his death, he was awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and a tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium, London.
        <br />
        In 2002, he placed number 58 in the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.
        <br />
        The 2018 film about Mercury and Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody, is the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time.
